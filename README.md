# MachineLearningSS23

## Lecture remark:

I am of immense gratitude and would like to thank both lecturers or professors for the knowledge gained and the opportunity to hone-in Machine learning paradigm using both R programing and Python. 

This Project submission will be a trickled down explanation to what I have grasped within our lectures. I seek to have represented the learning accordingly. Please pardon any misgiving should come short of capturing what was communicated throughout the semester.
